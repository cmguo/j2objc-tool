 @brief Transforms a JAR file to or from a packed stream in Pack200 format.
 Please refer to Network Transfer Format JSR 200 Specification at

  Typically the packer engine is used by application developers
  to deploy or host JAR files on a website.
  The unpacker  engine is used by deployment applications to
  transform the byte-stream back to JAR format. 
 <p>
  Here is an example using  packer and unpacker: 
 @code
   import java.util.jar.Pack200;
     import java.util.jar.Pack200.*;
     ...
     // Create the Packer object
     Packer packer = Pack200.newPacker();
     // Initialize the state by setting the desired properties
     Map p = packer.properties();
     // take more time choosing codings for better compression
     p.put(Packer.EFFORT, "7");  // default is "5"
     // use largest-possible archive segments (>10% better compression).
     p.put(Packer.SEGMENT_LIMIT, "-1");
     // reorder files for better compression.
     p.put(Packer.KEEP_FILE_ORDER, Packer.FALSE);
     // smear modification times to a single value.
     p.put(Packer.MODIFICATION_TIME, Packer.LATEST);
     // ignore all JAR deflation requests,
     // transmitting a single request to use "store" mode.
     p.put(Packer.DEFLATE_HINT, Packer.FALSE);
     // discard debug attributes
     p.put(Packer.CODE_ATTRIBUTE_PFX+"LineNumberTable", Packer.STRIP);
     // throw an error if an attribute is unrecognized
     p.put(Packer.UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE, Packer.ERROR);
     // pass one class file uncompressed:
     p.put(Packer.PASS_FILE_PFX+0, "mutants/Rogue.class");
     try {
         JarFile jarFile = new JarFile("/tmp/testref.jar");
         FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("/tmp/test.pack");
         // Call the packer
         packer.pack(jarFile, fos);
         jarFile.close();
         fos.close();
         File f = new File("/tmp/test.pack");
         FileOutputStream fostream = new FileOutputStream("/tmp/test.jar");
         JarOutputStream jostream = new JarOutputStream(fostream);
         Unpacker unpacker = Pack200.newUnpacker();
         // Call the unpacker
         unpacker.unpack(f, jostream);
         // Must explicitly close the output.
         jostream.close();
     } catch (IOException ioe) {

  <p>
  A Pack200 file compressed with gzip can be hosted on HTTP/1.1 web servers.
  The deployment applications can use "Accept-Encoding=pack200-gzip". This
  indicates to the server that the client application desires a version of
  the file encoded with Pack200 and further compressed with gzip. Please
  refer to  <a href="{@@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/deployment/deployment-guide/pack200.html">Java Deployment Guide</a> for more details and

/*!
 @brief The packer engine applies various transformations to the input JAR file,
  making the pack stream highly compressible by a compressor such as
  gzip or zip.An instance of the engine can be obtained
  using <code>newPacker</code>.
 The high degree of compression is achieved
  by using a number of techniques described in the JSR 200 specification.
  Some of the techniques are sorting, re-ordering and co-location of the
  constant pool. 
 <p>
  The pack engine is initialized to an initial state as described
  by their properties below.
  The initial state can be manipulated by getting the
  engine properties (using <code>properties</code>) and storing
  the modified properties on the map.
  The resource files will be passed through with no changes at all.
  The class files will not contain identical bytes, since the unpacker
  is free to change minor class file features such as constant pool order.
  However, the class files will be semantically identical,
  as specified in 
 <cite>The Java&trade; Virtual Machine Specification</cite>.
  <p>
  By default, the packer does not change the order of JAR elements.
  Also, the modification time and deflation hint of each
  JAR element is passed unchanged.
  (Any other ZIP-archive information, such as extra attributes
  giving Unix file permissions, are lost.) 
 <p>
  Note that packing and unpacking a JAR will in general alter the
  bytewise contents of classfiles in the JAR.  This means that packing
  and unpacking will in general invalidate any digital signatures
  which rely on bytewise images of JAR elements.  In order both to sign
  and to pack a JAR, you must first pack and unpack the JAR to
  "normalize" it, then compute signatures on the unpacked JAR elements,
  and finally repack the signed JAR.
  Both packing steps should
  use precisely the same options, and the segment limit may also
  need to be set to "-1", to prevent accidental variation of segment
  boundaries as class file sizes change slightly. 
 <p>
  (Here's why this works:  Any reordering the packer does
  of any classfile structures is idempotent, so the second packing
  does not change the orderings produced by the first packing.
  Also, the unpacker is guaranteed by the JSR 200 specification
  to produce a specific bytewise image for any given transmission
  ordering of archive elements.) 
 <p>
  In order to maintain backward compatibility, the pack file's version is
  set to accommodate the class files present in the input JAR file. In
  other words, the pack file version will be the latest, if the class files
  are the latest and conversely the pack file version will be the oldest
  if the class file versions are also the oldest. For intermediate class
  file versions the corresponding pack file version will be used.
  For example:
     If the input JAR-files are solely comprised of 1.5  (or  lesser)
  class files, a 1.5 compatible pack file is  produced. This will also be
  the case for archives that have no class files.
     If the input JAR-files contains a 1.6 class file, then the pack file
  version will be set to 1.6. 
 <p>
  Note: Unless otherwise noted, passing a <tt>null</tt> argument to a
  constructor or method in this class will cause a <code>NullPointerException</code>
  to be thrown.

 @brief This property is a numeral giving the estimated target size N
  (in bytes) of each archive segment.
 If a single input file requires more than N bytes,
  it will be given its own archive segment. 
 <p>
  As a special case, a value of -1 will produce a single large
  segment with all input files, while a value of 0 will
  produce one segment for each class.
  Larger archive segments result in less fragmentation and
  better compression, but processing them requires more memory. 
 <p>
  The size of each segment is estimated by counting the size of each
  input file to be transmitted in the segment, along with the size
  of its name and other transmitted properties. 
 <p>
  The default is -1, which means the packer will always create a single
  segment output file. In cases where extremely large output files are
  generated, users are strongly encouraged to use segmenting or break
  up the input file into smaller JARs. 
 <p>

  a larger Java heap (about ten times the segment limit).
