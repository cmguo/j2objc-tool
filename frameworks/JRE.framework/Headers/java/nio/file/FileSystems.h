 @brief Factory methods for file systems.This class defines the <code>getDefault</code>
  method to get the default file system and factory methods to
  construct other types of file systems.
 <p> The first invocation of any of the methods defined by this class causes
  the default <code>provider</code> to be loaded. The default
  provider, identified by the URI scheme "file", creates the <code>FileSystem</code>
  that provides access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual
  machine. If the process of loading or initializing the default provider fails
  then an unspecified error is thrown. 
 <p> The first invocation of the <code>installedProviders</code>
  method, by way of invoking any of the <code>newFileSystem</code>
  methods defined by this class, locates and loads all
  installed file system providers. Installed providers are loaded using the
  service-provider loading facility defined by the <code>ServiceLoader</code> class.
  Installed providers are loaded using the system class loader. If the
  system class loader cannot be found then the extension class loader is used;
  if there is no extension class loader then the bootstrap class loader is used.
  Providers are typically installed by placing them in a JAR file on the
  application class path or in the extension directory, the JAR file contains a
  provider-configuration file named <code>java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider</code>
  in the resource directory <code>META-INF/services</code>, and the file lists one or
  more fully-qualified names of concrete subclass of <code>FileSystemProvider</code>
  that have a zero argument constructor.
  The ordering that installed providers are located is implementation specific.
  If a provider is instantiated and its <code>getScheme</code>
  returns the same URI scheme of a provider that was previously
  instantiated then the most recently instantiated duplicate is discarded. URI
  schemes are compared without regard to case. During construction a provider
  may safely access files associated with the default provider but care needs
  to be taken to avoid circular loading of other installed providers. If
  circular loading of installed providers is detected then an unspecified error
  is thrown. 
 <p> This class also defines factory methods that allow a <code>ClassLoader</code>
  to be specified when locating a provider. As with installed providers, the
  provider classes are identified by placing the provider configuration file
  in the resource directory <code>META-INF/services</code>.
  
 <p> If a thread initiates the loading of the installed file system providers
  and another thread invokes a method that also attempts to load the providers
  then the method will block until the loading completes.

 @brief Returns the default <code>FileSystem</code>.The default file system creates
  objects that provide access to the file systems accessible to the Java
  virtual machine.
 The <em>working directory</em> of the file system is
  the current user directory, named by the system property <code>user.dir</code>.
  This allows for interoperability with the <code>java.io.File</code>
  class. 
 <p> The first invocation of any of the methods defined by this class
  locates the default <code>provider</code> object. Where the
  system property <code>java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider</code> is
  not defined then the default provider is a system-default provider that
  is invoked to create the default file system. 
 <p> If the system property <code>java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider</code>
  is defined then it is taken to be a list of one or more fully-qualified
  names of concrete provider classes identified by the URI scheme 
 <code>"file"</code>. Where the property is a list of more than one name then
  the names are separated by a comma. Each class is loaded, using the system
  class loader, and instantiated by invoking a one argument constructor
  whose formal parameter type is <code>FileSystemProvider</code>. The providers
  are loaded and instantiated in the order they are listed in the property.
  If this process fails or a provider's scheme is not equal to <code>"file"</code>
  then an unspecified error is thrown. URI schemes are normally compared
  without regard to case but for the default provider, the scheme is
  required to be <code>"file"</code>. The first provider class is instantiated
  by invoking it with a reference to the system-default provider.
  The second provider class is instantiated by invoking it with a reference
  to the first provider instance. The third provider class is instantiated
  by invoking it with a reference to the second instance, and so on. The
  last provider to be instantiated becomes the default provider; its <code>getFileSystem</code>
  method is invoked with the URI <code>"file:///"</code> to
  get a reference to the default file system. 
 <p> Subsequent invocations of this method return the file system that was
  returned by the first invocation.

 @brief Returns a reference to an existing <code>FileSystem</code>.
 <p> This method iterates over the <code>installed</code>

 <code>scheme</code> of the given URI. URI schemes are compared
  without regard to case. The exact form of the URI is highly provider
  dependent. If found, the provider's <code>getFileSystem</code>
  method is invoked to obtain a reference to the <code>FileSystem</code>
 .
  
 <p> Once a file system created by this provider is <code>closed</code>
  it is provider-dependent if this method returns a reference to
  the closed file system or throws <code>FileSystemNotFoundException</code>.
  If the provider allows a new file system to be created with the same URI
  as a file system it previously created then this method throws the
  exception if invoked after the file system is closed (and before a new
  instance is created by the <code>newFileSystem</code> method).
