/*!
 @brief A token representing the registration of a <code>watchable</code> object
  with a <code>WatchService</code>.
 <p> A watch key is created when a watchable object is registered with a watch
  service. The key remains <code>valid</code> until: 
 <ol>
    <li> It is cancelled, explicitly, by invoking its <code>cancel</code>
      method, or</li>
    <li> Cancelled implicitly, because the object is no longer accessible,
      or </li>
    <li> By <code>closing</code> the watch service. </li>
  </ol>
  
 <p> A watch key has a state. When initially created the key is said to be 
 <em>ready</em>. When an event is detected then the key is <em>signalled</em>
  and queued so that it can be retrieved by invoking the watch service's <code>poll</code>
  or <code>take</code> methods. Once
  signalled, a key remains in this state until its <code>reset</code> method
  is invoked to return the key to the ready state. Events detected while the
  key is in the signalled state are queued but do not cause the key to be
  re-queued for retrieval from the watch service. Events are retrieved by
  invoking the key's <code>pollEvents</code> method. This method
  retrieves and removes all events accumulated for the object. When initially
  created, a watch key has no pending events. Typically events are retrieved
  when the key is in the signalled state leading to the following idiom: 
 @code

      for (;;) {
          // retrieve key
          WatchKey key = watcher.take();
          // process events
          for (WatchEvent&lt;?&gt; event: key.pollEvents()) {
              :
          }
          // reset the key
          boolean valid = key.reset();
          if (!valid) {
              // object no longer registered
          }        }    
  
@endcode
  
 <p> Watch keys are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. Where there
  are several threads retrieving signalled keys from a watch service then care
  should be taken to ensure that the <code>reset</code> method is only invoked after
  the events for the object have been processed. This ensures that one thread
  is processing the events for an object at any time.

/*!
 @brief Returns the object for which this watch key was created.This method will
  continue to return the object even after the key is cancelled.
 <p> As the <code>WatchService</code> is intended to map directly on to the
  native file event notification facility (where available) then many of
  details on how registered objects are watched is highly implementation
  specific. When watching a directory for changes for example, and the
  directory is moved or renamed in the file system, there is no guarantee
  that the watch key will be cancelled and so the object returned by this
  method may no longer be a valid path to the directory.
