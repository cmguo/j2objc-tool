 @brief Copies all bytes from an input stream to a file.On return, the input
  stream will be at end of stream.
 <p> By default, the copy fails if the target file already exists or is a
  symbolic link. If the <code>REPLACE_EXISTING</code>
  option is specified, and the target file already exists,
  then it is replaced if it is not a non-empty directory. If the target
  file exists and is a symbolic link, then the symbolic link is replaced.
  In this release, the <code>REPLACE_EXISTING</code> option is the only option
  required to be supported by this method. Additional options may be
  supported in future releases. 
 <p>  If an I/O error occurs reading from the input stream or writing to
  the file, then it may do so after the target file has been created and
  after some bytes have been read or written. Consequently the input
  stream may not be at end of stream and may be in an inconsistent state.
  It is strongly recommended that the input stream be promptly closed if an
  I/O error occurs. 
 <p> This method may block indefinitely reading from the input stream (or
  writing to the file). The behavior for the case that the input stream is 
 <i>asynchronously closed</i> or the thread interrupted during the copy is
  highly input stream and file system provider specific and therefore not
  specified. 
 <p> <b>Usage example</b>: Suppose we want to capture a web page and save
  it to a file: 
 @code

      Path path = ...
      URI u = URI.create("http://java.sun.com/");
      try (InputStream in = u.toURL().openStream()) {
          Files.copy(in, path);
      }

 @brief Copy a file to a target file.
 <p> This method copies a file to the target file with the <code>options</code>
  parameter specifying how the copy is performed. By default, the
  copy fails if the target file already exists or is a symbolic link,
  except if the source and target are the <code>same</code> file, in
  which case the method completes without copying the file. File attributes
  are not required to be copied to the target file. If symbolic links are
  supported, and the file is a symbolic link, then the final target of the
  link is copied. If the file is a directory then it creates an empty
  directory in the target location (entries in the directory are not
  copied). This method can be used with the <code>walkFileTree</code>
  method to copy a directory and all entries in the directory,
  or an entire <i>file-tree</i> where required. 
 <p> The <code>options</code> parameter may include any of the following: 
 <table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary="">
  <tr> <th>Option</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <code>REPLACE_EXISTING</code> </td>
    <td> If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
      is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
      symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
      the link, is replaced. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <code>COPY_ATTRIBUTES</code> </td>
    <td> Attempts to copy the file attributes associated with this file to
      the target file. The exact file attributes that are copied is platform
      and file system dependent and therefore unspecified. Minimally, the     
 <code>last-modified-time</code> is
      copied to the target file if supported by both the source and target
      file stores. Copying of file timestamps may result in precision
      loss. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <code>NOFOLLOW_LINKS</code> </td>
    <td> Symbolic links are not followed. If the file is a symbolic link,
      then the symbolic link itself, not the target of the link, is copied.
      It is implementation specific if file attributes can be copied to the
      new link. In other words, the <code>COPY_ATTRIBUTES</code> option may be
      ignored when copying a symbolic link. </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
 <p> An implementation of this interface may support additional
  implementation specific options. 
 <p> Copying a file is not an atomic operation. If an <code>IOException</code>
  is thrown, then it is possible that the target file is incomplete or some
  of its file attributes have not been copied from the source file. When the 
 <code>REPLACE_EXISTING</code> option is specified and the target file
  exists, then the target file is replaced. The check for the existence of
  the file and the creation of the new file may not be atomic with respect
  to other file system activities. 
 <p> <b>Usage Example:</b>
  Suppose we want to copy a file into a directory, giving it the same file
  name as the source file: 
 @code

      Path source = ...
      Path newdir = ...
      Files.copy(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName());

 @param options options specifying how the copy should be done

 @throw FileAlreadyExistsException

           <code>REPLACE_EXISTING</code> option is not specified <i>(optional

 @throw DirectoryNotEmptyException
 the <code>REPLACE_EXISTING</code> option is specified but the file
           cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory          
 <i>(optional specific exception)</i>

 @brief Return a lazily populated <code>Stream</code>, the elements of
  which are the entries in the directory.The listing is not recursive.
 <p> The elements of the stream are <code>Path</code> objects that are
  obtained as if by <code>resolving</code> the name of the
  directory entry against <code>dir</code>. Some file systems maintain special
  links to the directory itself and the directory's parent directory.
  Entries representing these links are not included. 
 <p> The stream is <i>weakly consistent</i>. It is thread safe but does
  not freeze the directory while iterating, so it may (or may not)
  reflect updates to the directory that occur after returning from this
  method. 
 <p> The returned stream encapsulates a <code>DirectoryStream</code>.
  If timely disposal of file system resources is required, the 
 <code>try</code>-with-resources construct should be used to ensure that the
  stream's <code>close</code> method is invoked after the stream
  operations are completed. 
 <p> Operating on a closed stream behaves as if the end of stream
  has been reached. Due to read-ahead, one or more elements may be
  returned after the stream has been closed. 
 <p> If an <code>IOException</code> is thrown when accessing the directory
  after this method has returned, it is wrapped in an <code>UncheckedIOException</code>
  which will be thrown from the method that caused
  the access to take place.

 @brief Move or rename a file to a target file.
 <p> By default, this method attempts to move the file to the target
  file, failing if the target file exists except if the source and
  target are the <code>same</code> file, in which case this method
  has no effect. If the file is a symbolic link then the symbolic link
  itself, not the target of the link, is moved. This method may be
  invoked to move an empty directory. In some implementations a directory
  has entries for special files or links that are created when the
  directory is created. In such implementations a directory is considered
  empty when only the special entries exist. When invoked to move a
  directory that is not empty then the directory is moved if it does not
  require moving the entries in the directory.  For example, renaming a
  directory on the same <code>FileStore</code> will usually not require moving
  the entries in the directory. When moving a directory requires that its
  entries be moved then this method fails (by throwing an <code>IOException</code>
 ). To move a <i>file tree</i> may involve copying rather
  than moving directories and this can be done using the <code>copy</code>
  method in conjunction with the <code>Files.walkFileTree</code>
  utility method. 
 <p> The <code>options</code> parameter may include any of the following: 
 <table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary="">
  <tr> <th>Option</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <code>REPLACE_EXISTING</code> </td>
    <td> If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
      is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
      symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
      the link, is replaced. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <code>ATOMIC_MOVE</code> </td>
    <td> The move is performed as an atomic file system operation and all
      other options are ignored. If the target file exists then it is
      implementation specific if the existing file is replaced or this method
      fails by throwing an <code>IOException</code>. If the move cannot be
      performed as an atomic file system operation then <code>AtomicMoveNotSupportedException</code>
  is thrown. This can arise, for
      example, when the target location is on a different <code>FileStore</code>
      and would require that the file be copied, or target location is
      associated with a different provider to this object. </td>
  </table>
  
 <p> An implementation of this interface may support additional
  implementation specific options. 
 <p> Moving a file will copy the <code>last-modified-time</code>
  to the target
  file if supported by both source and target file stores. Copying of file
  timestamps may result in precision loss. An implementation may also
  attempt to copy other file attributes but is not required to fail if the
  file attributes cannot be copied. When the move is performed as
  a non-atomic operation, and an <code>IOException</code> is thrown, then the
  state of the files is not defined. The original file and the target file
  may both exist, the target file may be incomplete or some of its file
  attributes may not been copied from the original file. 
 <p> <b>Usage Examples:</b>
  Suppose we want to rename a file to "newname", keeping the file in the
  same directory: 
 @code

      Path source = ...
      Files.move(source, source.resolveSibling("newname")); 
  
@endcode
  Alternatively, suppose we want to move a file to new directory, keeping
  the same file name, and replacing any existing file of that name in the
  directory: 
 @code

      Path source = ...
      Path newdir = ...
      Files.move(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName()), REPLACE_EXISTING); 
  
@endcode
 @param source the path to the file to move
 @param target the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
            provider to the source path)
 @param options options specifying how the move should be done
 @return the path to the target file
 @throw UnsupportedOperationException
 if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
 @throw FileAlreadyExistsException
 if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the

 @brief Opens or creates a file, returning an output stream that may be used to
  write bytes to the file.The resulting stream will not be buffered.
 The
  stream will be safe for access by multiple concurrent threads. Whether
  the returned stream is <i>asynchronously closeable</i> and/or 
 <i>interruptible</i> is highly file system provider specific and
  therefore not specified. 
 <p> This method opens or creates a file in exactly the manner specified
  by the <code>newByteChannel</code>
  method with the exception that the <code>READ</code>
  option may not be present in the array of options. If no options are
  present then this method works as if the <code>CREATE</code>
 , <code>TRUNCATE_EXISTING</code>,
  and <code>WRITE</code> options are present. In other
  words, it opens the file for writing, creating the file if it doesn't
  exist, or initially truncating an existing <code>regular-file</code>
  to a size of <code>0</code> if it exists. 
 <p> <b>Usage Examples:</b>
  @code

      // truncate and overwrite an existing file, or create the file if
      // it doesn't initially exist

      // append to an existing file, create file if it doesn't initially exist
      out = Files.newOutputStream(path, CREATE, APPEND);

  detector's <code>probeContentType</code> is

  using the service-provider loading facility defined by the <code>ServiceLoader</code>
  class. Installed file type detectors are loaded using the system class
  loader. If the system class loader cannot be found then the extension class
  loader is used; If the extension class loader cannot be found then the
  bootstrap class loader is used. File type detectors are typically installed
  by placing them in a JAR file on the application class path or in the
  extension directory, the JAR file contains a provider-configuration file
  named <code>java.nio.file.spi.FileTypeDetector</code> in the resource directory 
 <code>META-INF/services</code>, and the file lists one or more fully-qualified

  option then symbolic links are

  of the link. 
 <p> If the <code>options</code> parameter contains the <code>FOLLOW_LINKS</code>
  option then the stream keeps
  track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
  arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
  directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the <code>file-key</code>
  of directories,
  or if file keys are not available, by invoking the <code>isSameFile</code>
  method to test if a directory is the same file as an
  ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error with
  an instance of <code>FileSystemLoopException</code>.
  
 <p> The <code>maxDepth</code> parameter is the maximum number of levels of

  file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of 
 <code>MAX_VALUE</code> may be used to indicate that all
  levels should be visited. 
 <p> When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
  (or directory), then it is ignored and not included in the stream. 
 <p> The returned stream encapsulates one or more <code>DirectoryStream</code>s.
  If timely disposal of file system resources is required, the 
 <code>try</code>-with-resources construct should be used to ensure that the
  stream's <code>close</code> method is invoked after the stream
  operations are completed.  Operating on a closed stream will result in an 
 <code>java.lang.IllegalStateException</code>.
  
 <p> If an <code>IOException</code> is thrown when accessing the directory

/*!
 @brief Walks a file tree.
 <p> This method walks a file tree rooted at a given starting file. The
  file tree traversal is <em>depth-first</em> with the given <code>FileVisitor</code>
  invoked for each file encountered. File tree traversal
  completes when all accessible files in the tree have been visited, or a
  visit method returns a result of <code>TERMINATE</code>
 . Where a visit method terminates due an <code>IOException</code>,
  an uncaught error, or runtime exception, then the traversal is terminated
  and the error or exception is propagated to the caller of this method. 
 <p> For each file encountered this method attempts to read its <code>java.nio.file.attribute.BasicFileAttributes</code>
 . If the file is not a
  directory then the <code>visitFile</code> method is
  invoked with the file attributes. If the file attributes cannot be read,
  due to an I/O exception, then the <code>visitFileFailed</code>
  method is invoked with the I/O exception. 
 <p> Where the file is a directory, and the directory could not be opened,
  then the <code>visitFileFailed</code> method is invoked with the I/O exception,
  after which, the file tree walk continues, by default, at the next 
 <em>sibling</em> of the directory. 
 <p> Where the directory is opened successfully, then the entries in the
  directory, and their <em>descendants</em> are visited. When all entries
  have been visited, or an I/O error occurs during iteration of the
  directory, then the directory is closed and the visitor's <code>postVisitDirectory</code>
  method is invoked.
  The file tree walk then continues, by default, at the next <em>sibling</em>
  of the directory. 
 <p> By default, symbolic links are not automatically followed by this
  method. If the <code>options</code> parameter contains the <code>FOLLOW_LINKS</code>
  option then symbolic links are
  followed. When following links, and the attributes of the target cannot
  be read, then this method attempts to get the <code>BasicFileAttributes</code>
  of the link. If they can be read then the <code>visitFile</code> method is
  invoked with the attributes of the link (otherwise the <code>visitFileFailed</code>
  method is invoked as specified above). 
 <p> If the <code>options</code> parameter contains the <code>FOLLOW_LINKS</code>
  option then this method keeps
  track of directories visited so that cycles can be detected. A cycle
  arises when there is an entry in a directory that is an ancestor of the
  directory. Cycle detection is done by recording the <code>file-key</code>
  of directories,
  or if file keys are not available, by invoking the <code>isSameFile</code>
  method to test if a directory is the same file as an
  ancestor. When a cycle is detected it is treated as an I/O error, and the 
 <code>visitFileFailed</code> method is invoked with
  an instance of <code>FileSystemLoopException</code>.
  
 <p> The <code>maxDepth</code> parameter is the maximum number of levels of
  directories to visit. A value of <code>0</code> means that only the starting
  file is visited, unless denied by the security manager. A value of 
 <code>MAX_VALUE</code> may be used to indicate that all
  levels should be visited. The <code>visitFile</code> method is invoked for all
  files, including directories, encountered at <code>maxDepth</code>, unless the
  basic file attributes cannot be read, in which case the <code>visitFileFailed</code>
  method is invoked. 
 <p> If a visitor returns a result of <code>null</code> then <code>NullPointerException</code>
  is thrown. 
 <p> When a security manager is installed and it denies access to a file
  (or directory), then it is ignored and the visitor is not invoked for
  that file (or directory).
