/*!
 @brief Service-provider class for file systems.The methods defined by the <code>java.nio.file.Files</code>
  class will typically delegate to an instance of this
  class.
 <p> A file system provider is a concrete implementation of this class that
  implements the abstract methods defined by this class. A provider is
  identified by a <code>URI</code> <code>scheme</code>. The default provider
  is identified by the URI scheme "file". It creates the <code>FileSystem</code> that
  provides access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual machine.
  The <code>FileSystems</code> class defines how file system providers are located
  and loaded. The default provider is typically a system-default provider but
  may be overridden if the system property <code>java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider</code>
  is set. In that case, the
  provider has a one argument constructor whose formal parameter type is <code>FileSystemProvider</code>
 . All other providers have a zero argument constructor
  that initializes the provider. 
 <p> A provider is a factory for one or more <code>FileSystem</code> instances. Each
  file system is identified by a <code>URI</code> where the URI's scheme matches
  the provider's <code>scheme</code>. The default file system, for example,
  is identified by the URI <code>"file:///"</code>. A memory-based file system,
  for example, may be identified by a URI such as <code>"memory:///?name=logfs"</code>.
  The <code>newFileSystem</code> method may be used to create a file
  system, and the <code>getFileSystem</code> method may be used to
  obtain a reference to an existing file system created by the provider. Where
  a provider is the factory for a single file system then it is provider dependent
  if the file system is created when the provider is initialized, or later when the 
 <code>newFileSystem</code> method is invoked. In the case of the default
  provider, the <code>FileSystem</code> is created when the provider is initialized. 
 <p> All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
  threads.

 @brief Checks the existence, and optionally the accessibility, of a file.
 <p> This method may be used by the <code>isReadable</code>,
  <code>isWritable</code> and <code>isExecutable</code>
  methods to check the accessibility of a file. 
 <p> This method checks the existence of a file and that this Java virtual
  machine has appropriate privileges that would allow it access the file
  according to all of access modes specified in the <code>modes</code> parameter
  as follows: 
 <table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary="">
  <tr> <th>Value</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <code>READ</code> </td>
    <td> Checks that the file exists and that the Java virtual machine has
      permission to read the file. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <code>WRITE</code> </td>
    <td> Checks that the file exists and that the Java virtual machine has
      permission to write to the file, </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <code>EXECUTE</code> </td>
    <td> Checks that the file exists and that the Java virtual machine has
      permission to <code>execute</code> the file. The semantics
      may differ when checking access to a directory. For example, on UNIX
      systems, checking for <code>EXECUTE</code> access checks that the Java
      virtual machine has permission to search the directory in order to
      access file or subdirectories. </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
 <p> If the <code>modes</code> parameter is of length zero, then the existence
  of the file is checked. 
 <p> This method follows symbolic links if the file referenced by this
  object is a symbolic link. Depending on the implementation, this method
  may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or other
  file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file. To
  determine the effective access to a file may require access to several
  attributes and so in some implementations this method may not be atomic
  with respect to other file system operations.
 @param path the path to the file to check
 @param modes The access modes to check; may have zero elements
 @throw UnsupportedOperationException
 an implementation is required to support checking for
           <code>READ</code>, <code>WRITE</code>, and <code>EXECUTE</code> access. This
           exception is specified to allow for the <code>Access</code> enum to
           be extended in future releases.

 @throw AccessDeniedException
 the requested access would be denied or the access cannot be

  is invoked when checking write access to the file,
           and <code>checkExec</code> is invoked
