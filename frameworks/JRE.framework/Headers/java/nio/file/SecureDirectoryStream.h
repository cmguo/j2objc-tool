/*!
 @brief A <code>DirectoryStream</code> that defines operations on files that are located
  relative to an open directory.A <code>SecureDirectoryStream</code> is intended
  for use by sophisticated or security sensitive applications requiring to
  traverse file trees or otherwise operate on directories in a race-free manner.
 Race conditions can arise when a sequence of file operations cannot be
  carried out in isolation. Each of the file operations defined by this
  interface specify a relative path. All access to the file is relative
  to the open directory irrespective of if the directory is moved or replaced
  by an attacker while the directory is open. A <code>SecureDirectoryStream</code>
  may also be used as a virtual <em>working directory</em>.
  
 <p> A <code>SecureDirectoryStream</code> requires corresponding support from the
  underlying operating system. Where an implementation supports this features
  then the <code>DirectoryStream</code> returned by the <code>newDirectoryStream</code>
  method will be a <code>SecureDirectoryStream</code> and must
  be cast to that type in order to invoke the methods defined by this interface. 
 <p> In the case of the default <code>provider</code>
 , and a security manager is set, then the permission checks are
  performed using the path obtained by resolving the given relative path
  against the <i>original path</i> of the directory (irrespective of if the
  directory is moved since it was opened).
