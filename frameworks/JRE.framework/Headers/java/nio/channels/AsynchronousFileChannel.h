 @brief An asynchronous channel for reading, writing, and manipulating a file.
 <p> An asynchronous file channel is created when a file is opened by invoking
  one of the <code>open</code> methods defined by this class. The file contains
  a variable-length sequence of bytes that can be read and written and whose
  current size can be <code>queried</code>. The size of the file increases
  when bytes are written beyond its  current size; the size of the file decreases
  when it is <code>truncated</code>.
  
 <p> An asynchronous file channel does not have a <i>current position</i>
  within the file. Instead, the file position is specified to each read and
  write method that initiates asynchronous operations. A <code>CompletionHandler</code>
  is specified as a parameter and is invoked to consume the result of the I/O
  operation. This class also defines read and write methods that initiate
  asynchronous operations, returning a <code>Future</code> to represent the pending
  result of the operation. The <code>Future</code> may be used to check if the
  operation has completed, wait for its completion, and retrieve the result. 
 <p> In addition to read and write operations, this class defines the
  following operations: </p>
  
 <ul>
    <li><p> Updates made to a file may be <code><i>forced
    out</i></code>
  to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not
    lost in the event of a system crash.  </p></li>
    <li><p> A region of a file may be <code><i>locked</i></code> against
    access by other programs.  </p></li>
  
 </ul>
  
 <p> An <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is associated with a thread pool to
  which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to completion
  handlers that consume the results of I/O operations on the channel. The
  completion handler for an I/O operation initiated on a channel is guaranteed
  to be invoked by one of the threads in the thread pool (This ensures that the
  completion handler is run by a thread with the expected <em>identity</em>).
  Where an I/O operation completes immediately, and the initiating thread is
  itself a thread in the thread pool, then the completion handler may be invoked
  directly by the initiating thread. When an <code>AsynchronousFileChannel</code> is
  created without specifying a thread pool then the channel is associated with
  a system-dependent default thread pool that may be shared with other
  channels. The default thread pool is configured by the system properties
  defined by the <code>AsynchronousChannelGroup</code> class. 
 <p> Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The 
 <code>close</code> method may be invoked at any time, as specified
  by the <code>Channel</code> interface. This causes all outstanding asynchronous
  operations on the channel to complete with the exception <code>AsynchronousCloseException</code>
 . Multiple read and write operations may be
  outstanding at the same time. When multiple read and write operations are
  outstanding then the ordering of the I/O operations, and the order that the
  completion handlers are invoked, is not specified; they are not, in particular,
  guaranteed to execute in the order that the operations were initiated. The 
 <code>ByteBuffers</code> used when reading or writing are not
  safe for use by multiple concurrent I/O operations. Furthermore, after an I/O
  operation is initiated then care should be taken to ensure that the buffer is
  not accessed until after the operation has completed. 
 <p> As with <code>FileChannel</code>, the view of a file provided by an instance of
  this class is guaranteed to be consistent with other views of the same file
  provided by other instances in the same program.  The view provided by an
  instance of this class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views
  seen by other concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the
  underlying operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols.
  This is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are
  written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other
  machine.  The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent
  and are therefore unspecified.

/*!
 @brief Forces any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage
  device that contains it.
 <p> If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when
  this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file
  since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
  will have been written to that device.  This is useful for ensuring that
  critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash. 
 <p> If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
  is made. 
 <p> The <code>metaData</code> parameter can be used to limit the number of
  I/O operations that this method is required to perform.  Passing 
 <code>false</code> for this parameter indicates that only updates to the
  file's content need be written to storage; passing <code>true</code>
  indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be
  written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation.
  Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the
  underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified. 
 <p> Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the
  channel was only opened for reading.  Some operating systems, for
  example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
  this time is updated whenever the file is read.  Whether or not this is
  actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified. 
 <p> This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to
  this channel's file via the methods defined in this class.
 @param metaData If 
 <code>true</code>  then this method is required to force changes           to both the file's content and metadata to be written to
            storage; otherwise, it need only force content changes to be
            written

 @brief Acquires a lock on the given region of this channel's file.
 <p> This method initiates an operation to acquire a lock on the given
  region of this channel's file. The <code>handler</code> parameter is a
  completion handler that is invoked when the lock is acquired (or the
  operation fails). The result passed to the completion handler is the
  resulting <code>FileLock</code>.
  
 <p> The region specified by the <code>position</code> and <code>size</code>
  parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
  underlying file.  Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
  initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
  region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
  If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
  required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
  expected maximum size of the file, should be locked.  The two-argument 
 <code>lock(Object,CompletionHandler)</code> method simply locks a region
  of size <code>Long.MAX_VALUE</code>. If a lock that overlaps the requested
  region is already held by this Java virtual machine, or this method has
  been invoked to lock an overlapping region and that operation has not
  completed, then this method throws <code>OverlappingFileLockException</code>.
  
 <p> Some operating systems do not support a mechanism to acquire a file
  lock in an asynchronous manner. Consequently an implementation may
  acquire the file lock in a background thread or from a task executed by
  a thread in the associated thread pool. If there are many lock operations
  outstanding then it may consume threads in the Java virtual machine for
  indefinite periods. 
 <p> Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
  request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
  an exclusive lock.  Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
  exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's <code>isShared</code>
  method. 
 <p> File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
  They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
  threads within the same virtual machine.

 @brief Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer, starting
  at the given file position.
 <p> This method initiates the writing of a sequence of bytes to this
  channel from the given buffer, starting at the given file position. The
  method returns a <code>Future</code> representing the pending result of the
  write operation. The <code>Future</code>'s <code>get</code> method
  returns the number of bytes written. 
 <p> This method works in the same manner as the <code>AsynchronousByteChannel.write(ByteBuffer)</code>
  method, except that bytes are
  written starting at the given file position. If the given position is
  greater than the file's size, at the time that the write is attempted,
  then the file will be grown to accommodate the new bytes; the values of
  any bytes between the previous end-of-file and the newly-written bytes
  are unspecified.
 @param src The buffer from which bytes are to be transferred
 @param position The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
            must be non-negative
 @return A <code>Future</code> object representing the pending result
 @throw IllegalArgumentException
 If the position is negative
