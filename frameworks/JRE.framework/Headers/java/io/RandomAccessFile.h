/*!
 @brief Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a
  random access file.A random access file behaves like a large
  array of bytes stored in the file system.
 There is a kind of cursor,
  or index into the implied array, called the <em>file pointer</em>;
  input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
  the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is
  created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available;
  output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
  the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write
  past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be
  extended. The file pointer can be read by the 
 <code>getFilePointer</code> method and set by the <code>seek</code>
  method. 
 <p>
  It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that
  if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been
  read, an <code>EOFException</code> (which is a kind of 
 <code>IOException</code>) is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for
  any reason other than end-of-file, an <code>IOException</code> other
  than <code>EOFException</code> is thrown. In particular, an 
 <code>IOException</code> may be thrown if the stream has been closed.

/*!
 @brief Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally to
  write to, the file specified by the <code>File</code> argument.A new <code>FileDescriptor</code>
  object is created to represent this file connection.
 <p>The <a name="mode"><tt>mode</tt></a> argument specifies the access mode
  in which the file is to be opened.  The permitted values and their
  meanings are: 
 <table summary="Access mode permitted values and meanings">
  <tr><th align="left">Value</th><th align="left">Meaning</th></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top"><tt>"r"</tt></td>
      <td> Open for reading only.  Invoking any of the <tt>write</tt>
      methods of the resulting object will cause an <code>java.io.IOException</code>
  to be thrown. </td></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top"><tt>"rw"</tt></td>
      <td> Open for reading and writing.  If the file does not already
      exist then an attempt will be made to create it. </td></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top"><tt>"rws"</tt></td>
      <td> Open for reading and writing, as with <tt>"rw"</tt>, and also
      require that every update to the file's content or metadata be
      written synchronously to the underlying storage device.  </td></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top"><tt>"rwd"&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></td>
      <td> Open for reading and writing, as with <tt>"rw"</tt>, and also
      require that every update to the file's content be written
      synchronously to the underlying storage device. </td></tr>
  </table>
  The <tt>"rws"</tt> and <tt>"rwd"</tt> modes work much like the <code>force(boolean)</code>
  method of
  the <code>java.nio.channels.FileChannel</code> class, passing arguments of 
 <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>, respectively, except that they always
  apply to every I/O operation and are therefore often more efficient.  If
  the file resides on a local storage device then when an invocation of a
  method of this class returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to
  the file by that invocation will have been written to that device.  This
  is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the
  event of a system crash.  If the file does not reside on a local device
  then no such guarantee is made. 
 <p>The <tt>"rwd"</tt> mode can be used to reduce the number of I/O
  operations performed.  Using <tt>"rwd"</tt> only requires updates to the
  file's content to be written to storage; using <tt>"rws"</tt> requires
  updates to both the file's content and its metadata to be written, which
  generally requires at least one more low-level I/O operation. 
 <p>If there is a security manager, its <code>checkRead</code> method is
  called with the pathname of the <code>file</code> argument as its
  argument to see if read access to the file is allowed.  If the mode
  allows writing, the security manager's <code>checkWrite</code> method is
  also called with the path argument to see if write access to the file is
  allowed.
