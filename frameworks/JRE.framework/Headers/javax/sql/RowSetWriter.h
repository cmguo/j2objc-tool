/*!
 @brief An object that implements the <code>RowSetWriter</code> interface,
  called a <i>writer</i>.A writer may be registered with a <code>RowSet</code>
  object that supports the reader/writer paradigm.
 <P>
  If a disconnected <code>RowSet</code> object modifies some of its data,
  and it has a writer associated with it, it may be implemented so that it
  calls on the writer's <code>writeData</code> method internally
  to write the updates back to the data source. In order to do this, the writer
  must first establish a connection with the rowset's data source. 
 <P>
  If the data to be updated has already been changed in the data source, there
  is a conflict, in which case the writer will not write
  the changes to the data source.  The algorithm the writer uses for preventing
  or limiting conflicts depends entirely on its implementation.
