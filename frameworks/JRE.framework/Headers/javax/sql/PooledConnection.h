 @brief An object that provides hooks for connection pool management.
 A <code>PooledConnection</code> object
  represents a physical connection to a data source.  The connection
  can be recycled rather than being closed when an application is
  finished with it, thus reducing the number of connections that
  need to be made. 
 <P>
  An application programmer does not use the <code>PooledConnection</code>
  interface directly; rather, it is used by a middle tier infrastructure
  that manages the pooling of connections. 
 <P>
  When an application calls the method <code>DataSource.getConnection</code>,
  it gets back a <code>Connection</code> object.  If connection pooling is
  being done, that <code>Connection</code> object is actually a handle to a 
 <code>PooledConnection</code> object, which is a physical connection. 
 <P>
  The connection pool manager, typically the application server, maintains
  a pool of <code>PooledConnection</code> objects.  If there is a 
 <code>PooledConnection</code> object available in the pool, the
  connection pool manager returns a <code>Connection</code> object that
  is a handle to that physical connection.
  If no <code>PooledConnection</code> object is available, the
  connection pool manager calls the <code>ConnectionPoolDataSource</code>
  method <code>getPoolConnection</code> to create a new physical connection.  The
   JDBC driver implementing <code>ConnectionPoolDataSource</code> creates a
   new <code>PooledConnection</code> object and returns a handle to it. 
 <P>
  When an application closes a connection, it calls the <code>Connection</code>
  method <code>close</code>. When connection pooling is being done,
  the connection pool manager is notified because it has registered itself as
  a <code>ConnectionEventListener</code> object using the 
 <code>ConnectionPool</code> method <code>addConnectionEventListener</code>.
  The connection pool manager deactivates the handle to the 
 <code>PooledConnection</code> object and  returns the 
 <code>PooledConnection</code> object to the pool of connections so that
  it can be used again.  Thus, when an application closes its connection,
  the underlying physical connection is recycled rather than being closed. 
 <P>
  The physical connection is not closed until the connection pool manager
  calls the <code>PooledConnection</code> method <code>close</code>.
  This method is generally called to have an orderly shutdown of the server or
  if a fatal error has made the connection unusable. 
 <p>
  A connection pool manager is often also a statement pool manager, maintining
   a pool of <code>PreparedStatement</code> objects.
   When an application closes a prepared statement, it calls the  
 <code>PreparedStatement</code>
  method <code>close</code>. When <code>Statement</code> pooling is being done,
  the pool manager is notified because it has registered itself as
  a <code>StatementEventListener</code> object using the 
 <code>ConnectionPool</code> method <code>addStatementEventListener</code>.
   Thus, when an application closes its  <code>PreparedStatement</code>,
  the underlying prepared statement is recycled rather than being closed.
