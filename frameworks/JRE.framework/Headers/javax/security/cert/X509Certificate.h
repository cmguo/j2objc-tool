 @brief Abstract class for X.509 v1 certificates.This provides a standard
  way to access all the version 1 attributes of an X.509 certificate.
 Attributes that are specific to X.509 v2 or v3 are not available
  through this interface. Future API evolution will provide full access to
  complete X.509 v3 attributes. 
 <p>
  The basic X.509 format was defined by
  ISO/IEC and ANSI X9 and is described below in ASN.1: 
 @code

  Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
      tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
      signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,
      signature            BIT STRING  } 
  
@endcode
  <p>
  These certificates are widely used to support authentication and
  other functionality in Internet security systems. Common applications
  include Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), Transport Layer Security (SSL),
  code signing for trusted software distribution, and Secure Electronic
  Transactions (SET). 
 <p>
  These certificates are managed and vouched for by <em>Certificate
  Authorities</em> (CAs). CAs are services which create certificates by
  placing data in the X.509 standard format and then digitally signing
  that data. CAs act as trusted third parties, making introductions
  between principals who have no direct knowledge of each other.
  CA certificates are either signed by themselves, or by some other
  CA such as a "root" CA. 
 <p>
  The ASN.1 definition of <code>tbsCertificate</code> is: 
 @code

  TBSCertificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
      version         [0]  EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
      serialNumber         CertificateSerialNumber,
      signature            AlgorithmIdentifier,
      issuer               Name,
      validity             Validity,
      subject              Name,
      subjectPublicKeyInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
      } 
  
@endcode
  <p>
  Here is sample code to instantiate an X.509 certificate: 
 @code

  InputStream inStream = new FileInputStream("fileName-of-cert");
  X509Certificate cert = X509Certificate.getInstance(inStream);
  inStream.close(); 
  
@endcode
  OR 
 @code

  byte[] certData = &lt;certificate read from a file, say&gt;
  X509Certificate cert = X509Certificate.getInstance(certData); 
  
@endcode
  <p>
  In either case, the code that instantiates an X.509 certificate
  consults the value of the <code>cert.provider.x509v1</code> security property
  to locate the actual implementation or instantiates a default implementation. 
 <p>
  The <code>cert.provider.x509v1</code> property is set to a default
  implementation for X.509 such as: 
 @code

  cert.provider.x509v1=com.sun.security.cert.internal.x509.X509V1CertImpl 
  
@endcode
  <p>
  The value of this <code>cert.provider.x509v1</code> property has to be
  changed to instantiate another implementation. If this security
  property is not set, a default implementation will be used.
  Currently, due to possible security restrictions on access to
  Security properties, this value is looked up and cached at class
  initialization time and will fallback on a default implementation if
  the Security property is not accessible. 
 <p><em>Note: The classes in the package <code>javax.security.cert</code>
  exist for compatibility with earlier versions of the
  Java Secure Sockets Extension (JSSE). New applications should instead
  use the standard Java SE certificate classes located in 
 <code>java.security.cert</code>.</em></p>
