 @brief Storage for files.A <code>FileStore</code> represents a storage pool, device,
  partition, volume, concrete file system or other implementation specific means
  of file storage.
 The <code>FileStore</code> for where a file is stored is obtained
  by invoking the <code>getFileStore</code> method, or all file
  stores can be enumerated by invoking the <code>getFileStores</code>
  method. 
 <p> In addition to the methods defined by this class, a file store may support
  one or more <code>FileStoreAttributeView</code> classes
  that provide a read-only or updatable view of a set of file store attributes.
 @since 1.7

 @brief Reads the value of a file store attribute.
 <p> The <code>attribute</code> parameter identifies the attribute to be read
  and takes the form: 
 <blockquote>
  <i>view-name</i><b>:</b><i>attribute-name</i>
  </blockquote>
  where the character <code>':'</code> stands for itself. 
 <p> <i>view-name</i> is the <code>name</code> of
  a <code>AttributeView</code> that identifies a set of file attributes. 
 <i>attribute-name</i> is the name of the attribute. 
 <p> <b>Usage Example:</b>
  Suppose we want to know if ZFS compression is enabled (assuming the "zfs"
  view is supported): 
 @code

     boolean compression = (Boolean)fs.getAttribute("zfs:compression"); 
  
@endcode
 @param attribute the attribute to read
 @return the attribute value; <code>null</code> may be a valid valid for some

           reading the attribute
