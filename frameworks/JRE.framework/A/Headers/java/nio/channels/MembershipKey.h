 @brief A token representing the membership of an Internet Protocol (IP) multicast
  group.
 <p> A membership key may represent a membership to receive all datagrams sent
  to the group, or it may be <em>source-specific</em>, meaning that it
  represents a membership that receives only datagrams from a specific source
  address. Whether or not a membership key is source-specific may be determined
  by invoking its <code>sourceAddress</code> method. 
 <p> A membership key is valid upon creation and remains valid until the
  membership is dropped by invoking the <code>drop</code> method, or
  the channel is closed. The validity of the membership key may be tested
  by invoking its <code>isValid</code> method. 
 <p> Where a membership key is not source-specific and the underlying operation
  system supports source filtering, then the <code>block</code> and <code>unblock</code>
  methods can be used to block or unblock multicast datagrams
  from particular source addresses.

  After a source address is blocked it may still be possible to receive
